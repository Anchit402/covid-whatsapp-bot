**Aim ✅:**

COVID has been really hard on everyone's life, many of them have lost their family members, relative, friends. Their loss is irreplaceable, seeing this situtaions me and my Team came up with an idea of making a chat bot which is easily accesible to everyone who needs some help regarding hopsitals, management of COVID +ve patients. We really hope to make some impact in these situations through our bot.


**Objective 🎯:**

During these tough times, many people are unable to know about the resources that are available near them. So at the moment when they or any of their close members are suffering from the same situation they are unable to make any spontaneous decision which results into dealy of actions and ultimately the person succumbs to the diseases. 

**Implementation 🆕:**

Creating a WhatsApp chat bot which tells the people about the nearest resources which can help them. We can help people by telling them about the hospitals, taking care of day to day activities (food management, etc). With the help of basic commands the people will be able to access the bot easily which helps them when such sort of situation arises. The website will help the people in recognising the commands of the bt and it will also help the people to add the bot to their WhatsApp with just one click.

The services currently available are:

Plasma Service <service-name> = **plasma**
Auto/Cab Service <service-name> = **auto**
Barbar Service <service-name> = **barbar**
Electrician Service <service-name> = **electrician**
Kirana Stores Service <service-name> = **kirana**
Medicine Service <service-name> = **medicine**
Mess / tiffin Service <service-name> = **mess**
Plumber Service <service-name> = **plumber**

The covid saviour bot gives you information on the availability of beds in hospitals. Also, it lets you store about the service you want to provide or use 

You can use the following commands:
1. **help / hi / hello** - Get this menu and all the commands you can use
2. **services** - Get a list of all the services available
3. **add** <service-name> <name> <password> <contact> <city> <location> - Add your service
4. **delete** <service-name> <password> - Delete your particular service
5. **get** <service-name> <city> - Find particular service in particular city

**Tech Stack 📚:**

- 
- Figma.
- Firebase.

**Future Scope 💡:**

Integrating Google Maps to give user the option to get directions to the required location within the bot. This will help the user reach the hospital quickly and the patient can get the first help really fast.

**Conclusion 😇:**

We are trying to solve the problem that we as a patient have faced when we were tested COVID +ve which, we know the tough situations thrugh which our families went. This bot aims to solve a few of them, there is still some room of improvement and we will be trying to enhance it.
